[Demonstration of end2end ml project in DataRobot](https://github.com/neeharikasinghsjsu/cmpe255assignments/blob/main/Lecture2_Assignments/Assignment1/datarobot_end2endML.m4v)

This has the end to end demonstration of an ML project. 
It uses a data set that indicates whether a cancer is **Benign(B)** or **Malignant(M)** based on the other individual characteristics.
Datarobot performs the data science and predicts the outcome wheter it is **B(Benign)** or **M(Malignant)** 

The dataset used is [here](https://github.com/neeharikasinghsjsu/cmpe255assignments/blob/main/Lecture2_Assignments/Assignment2/dataset/cancer_data.csv)
