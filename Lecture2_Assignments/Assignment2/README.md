[Binary Classification](https://github.com/neeharikasinghsjsu/cmpe255assignments/blob/main/Lecture2_Assignments/Assignment2/pycaret_binaryclassification.ipynb)

A dataset containing details about loan has been used.It contains the following data.
<ol>
  <li>loan_id :  An identifier for the loan.</li>
  <li>no_of_dependents:  Number of dependents of the loan applicant.</li>
  <li>education: Education level of the loan applicant (e.g., Graduate, Not Graduate).</li>
  <li>self_employed: Whether the loan applicant is self-employed or not.</li>
  <li>income_annum: Annual income of the loan applicant.</li>
  <li>loan_amount: The amount of loan requested.</li>
  <li>loan_term: The term (duration) for which the loan is requested.</li>
  <li>cibil_score: CIBIL score of the loan applicant (a measure of creditworthiness).</li>
  <li>residential_assets_value: Value of residential assets owned by the applicant.</li>
  <li>commercial_assets_value: Value of commercial assets owned by the applicant.</li>
  <li>luxury_assets_value: Value of luxury assets owned by the applicant.</li>
  <li>bank_asset_value: Value of assets in the bank.</li>
  <li>loan_status: The decision on the loan application (e.g., Approved, Rejected).</li>
</ol>

The prediction model **Extreme Gradient Boosting** has been used to determine the **loan_status** of an application as 

<ul>
  <li>Approved</li>
  <li>Rejected</li>
</ul>
