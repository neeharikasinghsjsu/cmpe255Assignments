The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for this project are:

1. `Calculator` class: This is the main class that will handle the logic of the calculator. It will have methods for each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and a method to clear the inputs.

2. `Application` class: This class will handle the GUI of the calculator. It will have methods to create the buttons and display box, and to update the display box based on user input.

3. `main` function: This is the entry point of the application. It will create an instance of the `Application` class and start the GUI.

4. `test_addition` function: This is a test case for the addition operation. It will create an instance of the `Calculator` class, perform an addition operation, and assert that the result is correct.

The project will consist of two files: `calculator.py` for the `Calculator` class, and `main.py` for the `Application` class and `main` function. The test case will be included in a separate file, `test_calculator.py`.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

calculator.py
